## Thread

Thread refers to an execution flow that is independent of the main execution flow or main program. By using threads, programs can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Each thread runs in parallel and can perform different tasks at the same time.

Threads can be created using a standard C++11 library and above, such as std::thread. Threads can be used to execute functions, class methods, and blocks of code asynchronously, so they don't affect the main program execution flow.
